Status report:
0.75ns Fastest Clock time for both synthesis files

We stalled out while trying to debug this part of the project. According to some of my peers, this may be due to my use of blocking statements within my always_ff instead of using non-blocking statements. I assumed that it wouldn't matter as long as you remain consistent throughout the always_ff. 
The current code is reporting errors on all [0]s, no matter if it exists in matrixA or matrixB. That is: outside of the first load (When the system is placed in the reset state), index [0] will always report the wrong  value due to index 0 never being updated in any case. I am aware this has to do with the code at around lines 171. To solve this issue, I would change the aWriteEnable/bWriteEnable to 1 a clock cycle sooner than it already is in the always_comb block. However, I cannot think of a series of inputs that would allow us to do it. 
Our block here does finish all test cases with 11469 errors.
