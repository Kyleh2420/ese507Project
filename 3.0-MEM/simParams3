# script to generate the params.sv file based on the command line parameters, 
# compile the code and testbench, and run simulation.
# usage: ./simParams3 [INW] [M] [N] [MAXK] [TVALID_PROB] [GUI]
#    where you will replace [INW] [M] [N] [MAXK] and [TVALID_PROB] with the 
#    desired value of those parameters.
#    Remember that if TVALID_PROB = 0, the testbench will randomize it.

#    if [GUI] is 0, the simulation will run in waveform mode. If [GUI] is 1, it will 
#    run QuestaSim in GUI mode
# example: for INW=16, M=5, N=4, MAXK=5 with random TVALID_PROB, simulating at the 
# command line only, run: 
#        ./simParams3 16 5 4 5 0 0

# If you want to run in GUI mode, you should run with & at the end, like
#        ./simParams3 16 5 4 5 0 1 &

# Note that this will compile all .sv files in your directory. If instead you
# only want to compile some of them, you can edit this or compile directly from the command line.
