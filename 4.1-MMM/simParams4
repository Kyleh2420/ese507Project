# script to generate the params.sv file based on the command line parameters, 
# compile the code and testbench, and run simulation.
# usage: ./simParams4 [INW] [OUTW] [M] [N] [MAXK] [TVALID_PROB] [TREADY_PROB] [GUI]
#    where you will replace [*] with the desired value of those parameters.
#    Remember that if TVALID_PROB/TREADY_PROB = 0, the testbench will randomize it.

#    if [GUI] is 0, the simulation will run in waveform mode. If [GUI] is 1, it will 
#    run QuestaSim in GUI mode

# example: for INW=12, OUTW=32, M=5, N=4, MAXK=5 with random TREADY/TVALID, simulating at the command line only, run: 
#        ./simParams4 12 32 5 4 5 0 0 0

# If you want to run in GUI mode, you should run with & at the end, like
#        ./simParams4 12 32 5 4 5 0 0 1 &

# Note that this will compile all .sv files in your directory. If instead you
# only want to compile some of them, you can edit this or compile directly from the command line.
